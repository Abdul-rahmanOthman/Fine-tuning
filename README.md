In this project we made an agent using Manichean learning , diagnosing children disease and my main part in this project was fine-tuning chat GPT 3.5 API on our training data then get the results , and then compare the accuracy between our agent and the fine-tuned model.
// i have used colab to run the code , its recomanded.
// you may need to dawonload some libraris to run the code
//you better to read the word txt file (fine tuning ) to understand all project aspects.
